# Unit Converter in C

This is a simple unit converter program in C that can convert between different units of length, temperature, and weight.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the C file (`unit_converter.c`) to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `unit_converter.c` file is located.

3. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

   ```
   gcc unit_converter.c -o unit_converter
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./unit_converter
   ```

5. The program will display a menu with the following conversion options:
   - 1. Length
   - 2. Temperature
   - 3. Weight
   - 4. Exit

6. Choose the conversion type by entering the corresponding number (e.g., enter `1` for length conversion).

7. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the value to be converted.

8. The program will display the converted result based on the chosen conversion type.

9. You can continue using the program by selecting other conversion types or choose to exit by entering `4`.

## Supported Conversions

### Length Conversion
- Convert from meters to feet and inches.

### Temperature Conversion
- Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Weight Conversion
- Convert from kilograms to pounds.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC) for compiling the C code.

## Note

This unit converter provides basic conversions for length, temperature, and weight. You can further enhance it by adding more conversion options or units to meet your specific needs.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements.
